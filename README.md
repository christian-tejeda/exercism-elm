# Elm exercises from Exercism

This repo contains code from Exercism's Elm learning track, dedicated to learning the Elm programming language.

Each folder corresponds to an exercise and contains a `README.md` with a description of the problem, its concepts involved and a solution, which can be found in the `src` folder.
